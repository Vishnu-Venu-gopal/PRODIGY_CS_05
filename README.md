# Task-05
Develop a packet sniffer tool that captures and analyzes network packets. Display relevant information such as source and destination IP addresses, protocols, and payload data. Ensure the ethical use of the tool for educational purposes.

## Network Packet Analyzer
A Network Packet Analyzer (also known as a network protocol analyzer, packet sniffer, or network analyzer) is a tool or software application used to capture, inspect, and analyze network packets transmitted over a network. These packets are the fundamental units of data communication in a network, and analyzing them helps in understanding and diagnosing network behavior, performance, and security. 
A packet sniffer is a tool used to capture and analyze network traffic. Developing such a tool involves capturing packets from the network and then analyzing the contents to extract information like source and destination IP addresses, protocols, and payload data. This can be used for network troubleshooting, monitoring, or educational purposes.
